```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# This is where you do initial setups, such as installing packagesloading libraries which allow for us 
# to do a lot of things in R.
# For the purposes of this activity, we will be learning how to make data visualizations using
# the pre-installed "USArrests" dataset.

# To begin, we are going to install a package called "ggplot2" to make data visualizations.
# "Tidyverse" will be installed as well to clean up data. 
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Once things are successfully installed, we will then load both "ggplot2" and "tidyverse" libraries so we can use it.
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

# We are also going to insert the pre-installed dataset "USArrests" into the "Environment" pane that you see 
# on your right.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
